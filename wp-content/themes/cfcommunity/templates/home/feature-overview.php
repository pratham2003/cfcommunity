          <strong><span>Members</span>: Connect to people in similar situations</strong>
          <p>
            Through our member directory you can find people who are in a similar situations as you. Not only can you easily find others based on name, location and interests, but you can find them based on CF related information.
            This means you could search for other people with a certain mutation and who have diabetes. Or maybe you and your partner would like to get in touch with others who have a child wish who live close to you. These are just two of the endless scenarios where our search will come in handy. And don't worry.. You can choose exactly which information you would like to share with others, and whether or not you want to be found by others through our search functionality.

          <strong><span>Causes:</span> Follow the Causes you care about</strong>
          <p>
        There are many amazing CF causes out there, and they are doing great things for people with CF. We want to make it easier for them to be found and for you to stay updated about the awesome work they do. This is why we creatd the Causes Directory where we try to list all the CF related caused across the world.</p>

        <p>

        A cause page can be created by any CF related cause or organisation. Once you decide to follow a cause you will receive updates from them in your newsfeed. 

        If you own or work for a cause you can use your cause page to stay in touch with the CF community. There is a lot of cool things you can add to your cause page, and you can read all about that here!

          <strong><span>Privacy:</span> What you do on CFCommunity stays on CFCommunity</strong>
          <p>
            We respect your privacy and data. Talking about CF is often a deeply personal thing. Sometimes you need to talk about things that are not meant for everyone and sites like Facebook make it as hard as humanly possible to do that. Their business is based on selling and showing your data to others.</p>

            <p>It's our mission to keep your data private and we will never show you advertisements or sell your data to anyone. And that's a super mega pinky promise.

          <strong><span>Newsfeed:</span> See what your friends are doing</strong>
          <p>
            The updates stream is where you’ll find an overview of all the activity that is important to you. It shows you the latest updates from your friends (blogposts they have written, discussion topics they have started and photos they have shared). It also shows the activity from the groups you’re part of and the CF related causes you follow! It’s similar to the Facebook Newsfeed but with no advertisements and more control over what is shown in your feed.

            Whilst you're reading this our community members are busy adding videos to our <a target="_blank" href="http://videos.cfcommunity.net/">CF Video site</a>. And our CFChimp is refining the recipe of his favorite Banana Cake on the <a target="_blank" href="http://recipes.cfcommunity.net/">Cooking with CF site</a>. We love creating sites in our network that are useful for the community!

            How about a medicine database where you can leave your experiences with certain meds and treatments? Or a site where you can ask and aswers CF related questions anonymously? We got plenty of ideas for the future and all of these sites are integrated with our main community. Have a cool idea for a site in our network? We'd love to hear it and work on it with you!
