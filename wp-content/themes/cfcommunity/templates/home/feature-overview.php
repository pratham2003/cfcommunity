      Do we need another community for people with CF? Can’t we just use Facebook? What makes us different? We've asked ourselves these, and many other questions whilst working on CFCommunity over the last five years.

            The updates stream is where you’ll find an overview of all the activity that is important to you. It shows you the latest updates from your friends (blogposts they have written, discussion topics they have started and photos they have shared). It also shows the activity from the groups you’re part of and the CF related causes you follow! It’s similar to the Facebook Newsfeed but with no advertisements and more control over what is shown in your feed.

          <strong>Blogs </strong>
          <p>
Every member of CFCommunity can start a fully functional site powered by WordPress. When you write a new post on your site all your friends on CFCommunity see this in their update stream. The idea is to create a network of sites, all part of CFCommunity. You can choose from a variety of designs based on the type of website you would like to start. A regular blog, photoblog (like Instagram), Vlog (video blog), a portfolio (creative work) or a website for your CF cause! If you already have an existing website you can still add you site to the sites directory through providing an RSS feed.

          <strong>Cause pages: An ov </strong>
          <p>
        Cause pages are centered around a Cystic Fibrosis related cause or organisation. Similar to “Facebook Pages” it allows anyone who has a cause/organisation or other initiative to create a space where they can post news, provide information and engage with the community. As a member you can easily “Follow” causes and automatically receive news and updates from that causes in your personal newsfeed.
