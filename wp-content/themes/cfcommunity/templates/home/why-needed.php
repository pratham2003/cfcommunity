      <p>
        <strong>People with Cystic Fibrosis are not allowed to have contact with one another.</strong> It increases the chance of lung infections and has the potential to reduce life expectancy.
        Now imagine that thousands of others also share this genetic disease but you won’t ever be able to meet with them in person. You won’t be able to get together to share stories, a shoulder, a helping hand, a hug, or build a community of support and encouragement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Online, however, we can interact and engage as much as we want. Online we can create a community and a support network. Online we can make friends. Being around people who truly understand you is important. This realisation is what sparked our ambition to create something for us; the Cystic Fibrosis community. This is why we created CFCommunity.

        CFCommunity is 100% dependent on donations! We have managed to start our dream project thanks to many donations from friends, family and people affected by Cystic Fibrosis all across the world. We are now an officially registered cause in the Netherlands and any donation for our cause would be amazing.
