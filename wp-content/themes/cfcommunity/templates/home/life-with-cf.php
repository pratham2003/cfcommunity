                <p>Due to segregation rules it's very hard for patients from the same hospital to ever meet. With CFCommunity we are building a platform where any hospital can very easily create a shared space for patients to talk amongst each other or with hospital staff. This is currently already done by some hospitals through Facebook but we strongly believe that Facebook is the wrong place for this due to lack of privacy and an commercial agenda. </p>
                <p>
                  When you create a discussion groups for your hospital a member of your staff has full control of who enters the group. Only after a person has been approved to enter the group the content will be viewable. Additionally your staff can upload documents/brochures to the group which can then directly be viewed by everyone inside the group.
